# MyHostels
A website that gives all the details regarding hostels around a college.

So not everyone gets admission in the college hostel.Those who didnt get the admission have to look for another private hostel or Paying Guest(PG) facility.Even if we google other hostels or PGs near our college,the results are not much useful as they do not provide much information about these places.
So my solution is to create a website that allows the user to select a college from a list of colleges provided in the website.After selecting the college the user will be shown a list of nearby hostels and PGs ranked from most preffered to least preferred based on the reviews of the seniors who have lived there.After the user clicks on the hostel/PG,the site will show a variety of information about the hostel like whether a mess is available for food,how much the rent is,how many rooms there are and how many rooms are left for staying, and many more other information about the hostel.Pictures of the hostel/PG will also be provided.Reviews about the hostel/PG by the seniors of the hostel and those who have graduated will also be there.Contact details of the hostel warden and the owner will also be there.There will also be a provision to take admission into the hostel/PG or book a room online itself via this website.There will be many more features to this website.
When I took admission in my college,the biggest problem i faced was finding a hostel as i couldnt get a room in the college hostel.I had to roam around my college,call a lot of my friends and seniors to ask them about hostels/PGs.Googling for hostels/PGs nearby proved to be useless as i didnt get much information from it even after visiting countless sites.I believe that this website will put an end to all those problems and all the freshers to college can easily find a hostel/PG and book a room without any hassle.
